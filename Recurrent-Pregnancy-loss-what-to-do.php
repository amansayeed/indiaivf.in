		<p>Recurrent pregnancy loss is classically defined as the occurrence of two or more consecutive pregnancy losses. A pregnancy loss is considered clinically-recognized when it involuntarily ends before 20 weeks. </p>
	
                                <h3>Causes:</h3>
	                          <ul>
								<li>Mostly pregnancy loss results from chromosomal, or genetic abnormalities, and are random events. The egg, sperm, or even the early embryo may be responsible for these abnormalities. Increasing maternal age is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, which may be due to poor egg quality leading to chromosomal (genetic) abnormalities. In some cases, the mother or father themselves may have mutations in their genes, but the offspring could be more severely affected and thus result in miscarriage.</li>
								
								<li>Abnormality in the uterus (the womb) may also lead to miscarriage. It may be due to poor blood supply or inflammation in the uterus. Some women are born with an abnormally shaped uterus, and some develop abnormalities in their uterus over time.
</li>
								<li>Hormonal imbalances seen in diseases such as thyroid and diabetes may also impact pregnancy loss. Abnormalities in a mother’s blood clotting process may also affect pregnancy loss.
</li>
								<li>Environmental factors, occupational factors and stress do not seem to be related to pregnancy loss.</li>								
								</ul>
								
								
					            <h3>Testing:</h3> 
								
								<ul>
								<li> Karyotype analysis of both parents: The karyotyping is done to find structural or numerical anomalies in the chromosomes of the parents.
</li>
								<li>Frequent evaluation of the uterus and the uterine cavity using techniques such as ultrasound, saline ultrasound, hysterosalpingogram X-ray, MRI, hysteroscopy (to look inside the uterus).
</li>
								<li>erus).
Antiphospholipid syndrome, which may be related to pregnancy loss will be checked using antiphospholipid antibodies, particularly an anticardiolipin antibody, and lupus anticoagulant.</li>
								<li>Thorough Genetic analysis of the parents: There could be a case where both of the parents are the carrier of some genetic mutations which gets aggravated in their progenies, leading to any structural or functional defect, resulting into an incomplete embryo formation. </li>
								</ul>
								
								
								<h3>Treatment:</h3>
								<ul>
								<li>Individuals having chromosomal abnormality are often referred for genetic counseling. </li>
								
								<li>If a uterine abnormality is diagnosed, surgery may be performed depending on the defect.
</li>
								<li>If antiphospholipid syndrome has been diagnosed, certain medications that can reduce blood clot formation may be given. </li>
								
								<li>If thyroid dysfunction or diabetes are diagnosed, specific medications could be prescribed.
</li>
	
								</ul>
