		<p>A Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a group of symptoms that affect the ovaries and ovulation. It is clinically represented as:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Cysts in the ovaries</li>
								<li>High levels of male hormones</li>
								<li>Irregular or skipped periods</li>
								<li>Abnormal facial hair growth</li>								
								</ul>
					            <h3>Causes</h3> 
								<p>In PCOS, many small, fluid-filled cyst like sacs grow inside the ovaries hence giving it a “polycystic” appearance. These sacs are follicles containing an immature egg. But these eggs do not attain enough maturity to trigger ovulation. The lack of ovulation imbalances the levels of female hormones such as  estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH. Eventually, the ratio of female hormones to male hormones gets disrupted leading to lower than usual estrogen and progesterone levels, while higher than usual androgen levels. This hormone imbalance causes skipping of menstrual periods and also creates problems in conception. It can contribute to long-term health problems like diabetes and heart disease. Contraceptive pills and diabetes drugs can help to fix the hormone imbalance and improve the symptoms.</p>
	                               <p> The exact causes of PCOS are still not known to doctors. It is believed that high levels of androgens prevent the ovaries from producing hormones and making eggs normally. Genes, insulin resistance, and inflammation have also been linked to the excess of androgen production.
</p>				
					            <h3>Symptoms of PCOS</h3>
								<p>Some women start seeing symptoms around the time of their first menstrual period. Others realize they have PCOS after they have gained a lot of weight or they had trouble getting pregnant.
								</p>

   <p> The most common PCOS symptoms are: </p>
   
   
   <p> <b> Irregular periods:</b> A lack of ovulation prevents the uterine lining from shedding every month. Some women with PCOS get less than eight periods in a year.
</p>
   <p> <b>Profuse bleeding:</b> The uterine lining builds up for a longer period of time, so the periods can be heavier than normal.
 </p>
<P> <b>Hair growth:</b> More than 70% of women in this condition experience hair growth on their face and body including their back, belly, and chest. Excessive hair growth is termed as hirsutism.
</P>

<p><b>Acne:</b>  Male hormones can make the skin oilier than normal and cause breakouts in areas like the face, chest, and upper back.<p>
<p><b>Weight gain:</b>  Approximately 80 percent of women with PCOS are overweight or obese.<p>
<p><b>Male-pattern baldness:</b> Hair on the scalp get thinner and start falling. <p>
<p><b>Darkening of the skin:</b> Dark patches can form in body creases on different areas like the neck, in the groin, and under the breasts <p>
<p><b>Headaches:</b> Hormone changes can trigger headaches in some women. <p>
<p>
To get pregnant, you have to ovulate. Women who are not able to ovulate regularly don’t release as many eggs to be fertilized. PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility in women. 
 <p>
 
 
 <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
<p>Lifestyle modifications are the first treatments doctors recommend for PCOS, and they often work well. Weight loss can also treat PCOS symptoms and improve the chances of getting pregnant. A balanced diet and aerobic exercise are two effective ways to lose weight. <p>
<p> Medicines are an option if lifestyle changes don’t work. Birth control pills and metformin can both restore more normal menstrual cycles and relieve PCOS symptoms.
<p>
<p> Many women find pregnancy success after trying in vitro fertilization as well. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can help to achieve pregnancy when other treatments have failed. The process involves fertilizing an egg outside the body and implanting it into the uterus to continue the pregnancy. There is a higher chance of multiple births with IVF.
