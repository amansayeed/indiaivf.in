							<h3>How does Ovulation Induction work?</h3> <p>First, we’ll confirm your ovulation cycle by:</p><ul><li>Taking blood samples to measure hormone levels at specific stages of the cycle,</li><li>Carrying out a transvaginal ultrasound to see the development of follicles in the ovaries, and the thickness and appearance of the lining of the womb.</li></ul><h3>The Ovulation Induction cycle</h3><ul><li><span class="org">Day 1:</span> (of your menstrual cycle) Call the clinic to arrange an appointment for a blood test.</li><li><span class="org">Day 2-4:</span> Start taking medication.</li><li><span class="org">Day 10 or 11:</span> Visit the clinic for a blood test to determine your hormone level. /an ultrasound.</li><li><span class="org">Day 14:</span> (approximate) Attend the clinic for an ultrasound test. This will determine if you are about to ovulate.</li></ul><p>For women who don’t have a normal menstrual cycle, it may take some time to ovulate. In fact, it is not unusual for ovulation to occur much later in their cycle (after Day 14). You would then need to continue attending the clinic until you ovulate.</p><p>There are various treatments to treat ovulation disorders.</p><p>These medications may cause multiple follicle development, with the risk of multiple pregnancy. For this reason you need to undergo regular ultrasounds to determine the number and rate of growth of these follicles. If more than one follicle develops, your fertility specialist will discuss the risks of multifollicular ovulation.</p><p><span class="org">The Trigger:</span> After the follicle has developed we may use another injection of synthetic human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger the release of the egg from the follicle.The fertile time is for 36 hours from the time of trigger.</p>
