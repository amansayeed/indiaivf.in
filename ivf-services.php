						<h3>We try to provide you with the utmost services :</h3>
							<ol><li><span class="org">Your initial consultation :</span> It is an initial visit in which you open up with your doctor and know your doctor and the doctor knows you. A detailed history is taken of the couple.</li><li><span class="org">Pretreatment preparation and planning management :</span> This will include a detailed blood workup which will include your hormonal assays , a uterine assessment, semen analysis and other tests if required. We review the whole history and all the tests and then only a definitive management is planned for you.</li><li><span class="org">Start of oral contraceptive pills :</span> You will be put on oral contraceptive pills for a short span of two to four weeks if your cycle needs to be synchronized with that of an egg donor or surrogate . These help the ovaries to be cyst free and help in planning of your cycle.</li><li><span class="org">Ovarian induction :</span> The IVF cycle begins with ovarian stimulation with injectable hormones on a daily basis and serial ultrasound monitoring. A baseline ultrasound is done before starting the stimulation to assess egg production. The hormone levels will also be monitored . Once the follicles reach the optimal size , you are prepared for egg retrieval.</li><li><span class="org">Visits :</span> Prior to egg retrieval three to five visits are done in that IVF cycle.</li><li><span class="org">Egg Maturation :</span> An injection is given 34-36 hrs prior to egg retrieval.</li><li><span class="org">Egg retrieval :</span> It is a procedure done transvaginally under ultrasound guidance under short general anesthesia . You need to be six hrs. fasting prior to the procedure.A long thin needle is passed through the vagina in the ovary and the follicular fluid is aspirated .The follicular fluid is collected in test tubes under strict temperature control and immediately given to the embryologist in the embryology lab. The embryologist searches for the eggs. The eggs are rinsed counted and placed in an incubator . After few hrs , they are fertilized with the sperm either through IVF or through ICSI.<p>An anesthesiologist is there to give you pain relief and comfort during the procedure. Chances of injury during egg retrieval is extremely rare. Structures near the ovary such as bladder,bowel or blood vessels could possibly be damaged and may require further surgery. Minimal bleeding from ovaries might occur but the risk of transfusion is extremely rare. Infection during this procedure is also extremely rare. You will be discharged four hrs. after the procedure.</p></li><li><span class="org">Embryo Assessment :</span> During IVF embryos are assessed for 2-5 days in a temperature controlled incubator. The embryos are assessed and the day of transfer is determined between day 2-day 5 . We call you to update you about the embryos.</li><li><span class="org">Embryo Transfer :</span> Embryo is transferred back in the uterine cavity between day 2-day5 when it becomes multi celled /blastocyst . This requires no anesthesia and the female is happy to see her embryos being implanted in the cavity . We discuss the number of embryos and made and the number to be transferred so that you have the highest probability of success keeping in mind the risk of multiple birth associated with it. For embryo transfer you need to come on a full bladder and the procedure is done via an embryo catheter transferred vaginally under ultrasound guidance.</li><li><span class="org">Pregnancy test :</span> We schedule a pregnancy test 10-15 days after the transfer . If the first test is positive we repeat beta hcg repetitively every 48-72 hrs. and an obstetrical ultrasound is planned two weeks following the pregnancy test when we look for the no. of embryos and fetal cardiac activity.</li></ol>

							<p>If you are diagnosed with male fertility problems, such as a low sperm count ,previous history of vasectomy in male partner ,recurrent ivf failure then conventional IVF is unlikely to result in fertilisation. It is also done when sperms are not present in the semen and they have to be obtained surgically from testicles.This is when Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI treatment) is recommended. It is like IVF only the main difference is the technique we use to achieve fertilisation.</p><h3>How is ICSI done ?</h3><p>A single sperm is injected into each egg, using very fine micro-manipulation equipment. As the human egg is one tenth of a millimetre in diameter and the sperm 100 times smaller, this is a very delicate procedure performed by highly skilled&nbsp;embryologist under a micro-manipulator.</p><h3>Is ICSI successful?</h3><p>Together with IVF, ICSI is one of the most common techniques used in&nbsp;Assisted reproductive technology. Since it was introduced, it has led to the birth of many thousands of babies worldwide.</p><p>

						<h3>The main methods of surgical sperm retrieval available include:</h3><ul><li><span class="org">PESA:</span> percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration.</li><li><span class="org">MESA:</span> microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration.</li><li><span class="org">TESA:</span> testicular sperm aspiration. This includes testicular fine needle aspiration (TFNA).</li><li><span class="org">TESE:</span> testicular sperm extraction.</li><li><span class="org">Microdissection TESE</span>.</li><li><span class="org">Perc biopsy:</span> percutaneous biopsy of the testis.</li></ul><p>Which method is used depends on the nature of the problem in the male partner, which needs to be explored carefully first.</p><h3>Tests required before surgical sperm retrieval</h3><p>A man that produces no sperm in his semen is said to have azoospermia. This may be because of a blockage in one of the tubes that carry sperm from the areas of the testes where they are produced, out to the penis during ejaculation. Obstructive azoospermia can be caused by testicular cancer, as the tumour presses on the vas deferens. This type of cancer is common in young men and can be treated successfully. It can, however, lead to infertility, so surgical sperm retrieval may be performed to store some sperm before treatment begins.</p><p>Other conditions cause non-obstructive azoospermia, including having an abnormal cystic fibrosis gene. Men with this condition may not show all the symptoms, but they often have no vas deferens. Surgical sperm retrieval is possible but there is a 50:50 chance that the embryos produced by subsequent ICSI and IVF will have the same genetic abnormality. Options then include using a sperm donor and intrauterine insemination (IUI) or IVF, or having pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) performed on the embryos to select ones that carry the normal gene.</p><p>If the problem that underlies poor sperm production is physical rather than genetic, or if a couple wants to have children after the male partner has had a vasectomy that cannot be reversed, surgical sperm retrieval can go ahead.</p><h3>Surgical sperm retrieval techniques used when obstruction is the problem</h3><p>When the release of sperm is prevented by a blockage in the vas deferens, or by a vasectomy, several techniques can be used to retrieve the large numbers of sperm that remain inside the testes. The first three involve aspirating sperm using needles or tubes placed through the skin of the testis and are carried out under local anaesthetic. The fourth requires open surgical sperm retrieval and is usually carried out under general anaesthetic.</p><ul><li><span class="org">TESA:</span> testicular sperm aspiration. This involves placing a needle attached to a syringe through the skin of the scrotum and simply sucking out the fluid inside the testicle.</li><li><span class="org">PESA:</span> percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. This involves the same needle and syringe technique but the needle is placed directly into the epididymis.</li><li><span class="org">Perc biopsy:</span> percutaneous biopsy of the testis. This is similar to TESA, but a larger needle is used. This is a 14 gauge needle usually used to biopsy testicular tissue and it usually extracts a larger number of sperm.</li><li><span class="org">MESA:</span> microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration. An open surgical sperm retrieval procedure that uses an operating microscopy to locate the tubules of the epididymis precisely, so that large numbers of sperm can be extracted.</li></ul><p>Some small studies have been done to compare success rates after the different types of surgical sperm retrieval. These concluded that MESA gives the highest number of sperm, with a hundred times more sperm being recovered compared to TESA and perc biopsy.</p><p>MESA also produced sperm that were better swimmers and therefore more useful for infertility treatments, including IVF and ICSI.</p><h3>Surgical sperm retrieval techniques when there is no obstruction</h3></li><p>Men who have no sperm in their semen, despite having clear tubes in their testicles, usually have a problem with the process of sperm production. It is unlikely that sperm are present in large numbers, so the surgical sperm retrieval techniques required are more invasive.</p><ul><li><span class="org">TESE:</span> testicular sperm extraction. This involves opening up the scrotum and taking a large volume of testicular tissue, perhaps from several regions of the testicle. Sperm are then retrieved using a microscope to identify individual sperm.</li><li><span class="org">Microdissection TESE</span>. A similar technique but a microdissecting microscope is used to pinpoint the tissue to be removed. This aims to cause less damage to the structure inside the testicle, and to therefore have fewer after effects such as blood supply problems caused by tiny blood vessels being cut. It also appears to increase the number of sperm that can be retrieved.<h3>Success rates after surgical sperm retrieval</h3></li><p>Evidence is still accumulating because all of these infertility treatments are relatively new, but one of the most successful combinations appears to be MESA followed by ICSI, which has reported fertilisation and pregnancy rates between 45 % and 52 %.</p></ul>

							<p>During IVF, the embryos are cultured for up to six days and receive quality grades each day.</p><h3>Egg Retrieval and Insemination Day 0</h3>Egg maturity is important because a mature egg has the best chance of being fertilized. There are three different stages of egg maturation:<ul><li><span class="org">Germinal vesicle (GV):</span> The egg has not begun meiosis yet, so it is considered immature.</li><li><span class="org">Metaphase I (MI):</span> The egg is in the first phase of meiosis; however, it is still not completely mature because it has not entered the second phase of meiosis. This kind of immature egg may mature after a couple of hours of temperature-controlled incubation.</li><li><span class="org">Metaphase II (MII):</span> The egg is in the second phase of meiosis and is mature. Eggs at this stage of maturity are ready for fertilization.</li><li><span class="org">Good</span><ul><li>Clear cytoplasm/normal shape</li><li>Single distinct polar body</li><li>Clear/thin zona pellucida</li></ul></li><li><span class="org">Fair</span><ul><li>Slightly grainy cytoplasm/misshapen</li><li>Fragmented/abnormal polar body</li><li>Slightly pigmented/amorphous zona</li><li>Cytoplasmic bodies</li><li>PV debris</li></ul></li><li><span class="org">Poor</span><ul><li>Dark/grainy cytoplasm/misshapen</li><li>&gt;1 polar body structure</li><li>Pigmented/thickened zona</li><li>Vacuoles</li><li>PV debris</li></ul></ul> <h3>Fertilization Check Day One</h3></li><p>Fertilization can be seen 16 to 22 hours post insemination. Normal fertilization is identified by exactly two pronuclei in the center of the single cell zygote. Fertilization is considered abnormal when there is only one pronucleus or when there are more than two pronuclei.</p><h3>Multicell Grading Day Two/Three</h3></li><p>On day two the single cell zygote should divide into an embryo (approx. two to four cells). On day three the embryo should continue to divide (four to eight cells).</p><h3>Embryo Quality:</h3><ul><li><span class="org">Good:</span> cells are symmetrical with clear cytoplasm</li><li><span class="org">Fair:</span> cells are slightly asymmetrical and/or have slight cytoplasmic irregularities</li><li><span class="org">Poor:</span> cells are significantly asymmetrical and/or have dark, grainy cytoplasm</li><li>A = No fragmentation</li><li>B = &lt;10% fragmentation</li><li>C = 10-35% fragmentation</li><li>D = &gt;35% fragmentation</li></ul><h3>Day Four</h3><p>On day four, embryos begin their transition from a multicell embryo to a more advanced developmental stage. Embryos should begin compacting and forming morulae. Cells of a morula-stage embryo are not as distinct as in previous days; therefore, these embryos do not receive quality grades.</p><h3>Day Five/Six Blastocyst Stage</h3><p>A blastocyst is a highly developed embryo that is composed of two different cell types: one group of cells, called the inner cell mass, leads to fetal tissue and another group of cells, called the trophectoderm, forms the placenta. Blastocysts are graded on their expansion (early, expanding, expanded, and hatching) as well as the quality of the two different cell types (graded on a good-fair-poor scale). Blastocysts that are good to fair quality meet freeze criteria.</p>

						<p>How we decide on which day to transfer your embryos</p><p>Embryo transfer represents the final stage of the IVF treatment and is the climax of the IVF treatment cycle. How do we decide on which day to transfer your embryos ? Day 1 ? Day 2 ? 3 ? 5 ? Which is better ? and why ?<p>Unfortunately, human reproduction is not a very efficient enterprise. most embryos do not become babies. This is because many embryos have a genetic error ( which is often random) and will not implant, because Nature will prevent them from doing so. This is why the implantation rate even for top quality embryos is about 40%.</p><p>We are very flexible on the day of embryo transfer to increase our chances of success.</p><h3>Uterine Embryo Transfer</h3><ul><li>This is the standard procedure. In this procedure, the Embryos are directly transferred into the uterine cavity.</li><li>The procedure usually does not need Anaesthesia.</li><li>Number of embryos to transfer is decided considering the day on which the transfer is performed.</li></ul><h3>On which day post icsi/ivf, can we perform embryo transfer ?</h3><p>Generally embryos are transferred on Day 2, Day 3 and Day 5 post ICSI / IVF. Remember that day of egg collection is Day 0.</p><h3>How do we decide on which day to transfer your embryos back to the uterus?</h3><p><span class="blue">There are multiple variables which we consider while deciding when to transfer your embryos back to your uterus.</span></p><p></p><ul><li>Number of Follicles developed during superovulation:</li><li>Number of eggs retrieved after Vaginal Egg Collection</li><li>Total number of Mature Eggs (MII) injected</li><li>Number of Eggs fertilized (i.e. Eggs with 2 pronuclei in them)</li><li>Day 2 transfer can be considered for all patients.</li><li>Need to have at least 6 embryos on Day 1 to consider transferring embryos on Day 3</li><li>High number of Supernumerary Embryos can be frozen after transferring the best embryos into your uterus.</li><li>Only 40 % Embryos make it to Day 5. This means patients with few eggs and those with a low fertilization rate cannot be considered for Day 5 Embryo Transfer.</li><li>Low Freezing rate for supernumerary embryos as all Embryos don’t turn out to be top quality on Day 5.</li></ul>
